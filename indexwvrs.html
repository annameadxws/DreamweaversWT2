  Dewey Frye is dead and the rest of his family is left to pick up the pieces -- that is if they don't kill each other first. Not only does matriarch Dorothy have to contend with sudden widowhood, but she's also faced with church-committee harpy Ozella Meeks sticking her nose in the family business, Dewey's snake-in-the-grass brother making a grab for her house, and two grown daughters reliving their childhood rivalry. Funerals bring out the worst, the best, and the funniest in people, and the Fryes are no exception. A big-hearted comedy about family -- Southern-style.
Show Dates: Friday, October 27at 7PM, Saturday, October 28 at 7PM & Sunday, October 29, 2017 at 2PM.                     
  Theater ticket window opens one hour prior to show time!

<h2>What is Dreamweavers?</h2>
<p> The Dreamweavers of West Tennessee is a volunteer, non-profit 501c3 community theater group located in a city owned, renovated movie theater on 601 Court St in historic downtown Savannah, Tennessee. Dreamweavers was founded in 1994, by M. I. Marshall, who conceived the idea, Jim Osburn, who willingly joined his fledgling Hardin County Harlequins with Dreamweavers, and Terry Marshall and Margaret Osburn, who provided the artistic and day to day support for the community theater. Over the past twenty three years Dreamweavers has presented more than hundred musicals, dramas and comedies. Dreamweavers presents several live theatrical works each year, including a major musical production in the summer.  Membership is open and does not include any fees.  Participate in any event, any way, and you are already a "MEMBER". Membership is automatically renewed if you participate in at least one event produced by Dreamweavers each year.</p>
