<p><b>How do I become a sponsor?</b>  As a not-for-profit community organization we welcome sponsorship to assist in general overhead costs.  To become a sponsor, contact any member of the Board of Directors.  Thank you for your support!  </p>
<p><b>What should I do to prepare for acting tryouts?</b>  The Libretto is an excellent source for Actors interested in auditioning to prepare for tryouts by reading over parts and looking at which songs the characters sing (if the character you are trying out for has a singing part).  A link to the applicable Libretto will be posted when available, under the "Current Openings" and/or "Member News" section of the Dreamweavers web site.  During the tryouts you will probably be asked to read some of the lines from the libretto.  It is also recommended that you work on "getting into your character", including voice, posture, etc. so you can give a clear impression of the character and showcase it as you read the lines. </p>
<p><b>I want to audition.  What can I do to help build a "stronger" voice?</b>  Often, in stage musicals, your voice is only one part of what a director looks for in casting. Your ability to "emote" on stage (make your feelings and expressions clear to the audience), how well the director sees that you fit the character image and your willingness to take direction and work hard at developing the role are all significant. If you do not have a voice teacher, you may want to take some lessons to help with projection. Practice every day to improve tone and delivery. In the final decision made by the director, your natural talent and delivery will make the difference.</p>
<p><b>Who do I contact about updates to this website?</b>  Email updates, corrections and additions to the Dreamweavers WebMaster.  For upcoming events, please provide all details including a description of the event, the date and time, cost to the public if other than the standard ticket cost, and if there are any position openings (actors, vocalists, instrumentalists, stage hands, managers, assistants, etc.) </p>
